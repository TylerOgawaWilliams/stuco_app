Modern Python Projects using `Poetry`_
----------------------------------------

To install **stuco_app** into a poetry enabled project, simply run this command in your terminal:

.. code-block:: console

    $ poetry add stuco_app

This is the preferred method to install stuco_app, as it will always install the most recent stable
that is compatible with all of the other dependencies in your project.

--------

More Traditional Python Projects using `pip`_
-----------------------------------------------

Even traditional python projects should be using a python virtual environment.

You can create and activate a python virtual environment with these commands in your terminal:

.. code-block:: console

    $ python -m venv .venv
    $ source .venv/bin/activate

To install **stuco_app** into a traditional project using pip, simply run this command in your terminal:

.. code-block:: console

    $ python -m pip install stuco_app

.. _pip: https://pip.pypa.io
.. _poetry: https://python-poetry.org/
